"""Deterministic shard allocation for lineage generations.

Frozen spec (Pilot 1):
  |D_g| = S * B_eff = 300 * 16 = 4800  ->  coverage C = 1 exactly
  D_i disjoint from D_j, and all disjoint from the planting block.

Coverage-1 is enforced by CONSTRUCTION and asserted at run time, not left to
coincide with the arithmetic of a shuffling DataLoader.  Shard membership is a
fixed permutation seeded once, so lineages are reproducible and shards never
collide across seeds or reruns.
